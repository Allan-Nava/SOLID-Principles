# SOLID-Princples

The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.

These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.

This article will teach you everything you need to know to apply SOLID principles to your projects.

We will start by taking a look into the history of this term. Then we are going to get into the nitty-gritty details – the why's and how's of each principle – by creating a class design and improving it step by step.

So grab a cup of coffee or tea and let's jump right in!
